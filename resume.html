           <img src="emhawv.png" alt="Emily Hawver, smiling" height="200"/>
           <p>I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student with an eclectic blend of interests, about all of which I am highly passionate and seeking further involvement. My diverse experience — from local blood drives to epidemiological research — has afforded me excellent interpersonal and time management skills which I look forward to applying in dynamic workplace environments and situations.</p>
