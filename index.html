            <h1>Emily Hawver</h1>
            <p>This is my first webpage for JMM 341 Web Design!  After some in-class practice, I'm feeling pretty comfortable coding basic html webpages.  This is, however, my first time creating and adding to a repository on GitHub, so hopefully this works.</p>
            <h2>Why did I want to take this course?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have a strong academic and professional background in graphic design.</li>
                <li>I took a data visualization course last semester and fell in love, and I feel like web design is a really complimentary skillset.</li>
                <li>Web design can be a really valuable resum√©-builder and will probably (hopefully) be useful in my future career.</li>
                <li>I get a little too frustrated by the limitations of website-building services, such as WordPress and SquareSpace.  It would be nice to have more creative control.</li>
                <li>My computer engineer father will be so proud; he's wanted me to get into coding since I was little, and I'm finally doing it!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is the GitHub logo, the Octocat, which is exceedingly adorable.</p>
